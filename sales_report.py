# we could then set a parameter for the function as filename so we could run 
# this function on any file, not just sales-report.txt

    # check if our list of salespeople already contains the person in question
    if salesperson in salespeople:
        # if it does, then save the index of where the salesperson is in the list
        position = salespeople.index(salesperson)
        # and add to the count in the melons_sold list at the same index
        melons_sold[position] += melons

        salespeople.append(salesperson)

# print a formatted string for each salesperson saying what they sold 
for i in range(len(salespeople)):
    print(f'{salespeople[i]} sold {melons_sold[i]} melons')

# this solution is confusing to deal with and difficult to access all relevant
# information for a specific salesperson
# instead it would be more clear to store the data in a dictionary where the 
# salesperson is the key and the melon price total and count are values
